# Repo Issue Intelligence

Repository-aware GitHub issue prioritization and investigation, built around an explicit two-stage workflow: rank every open issue cheaply, then investigate only the highest-value issues against the codebase.

The project is an initial, runnable MVP. It does not require an LLM API to produce useful results. Priority decisions are explainable, repository evidence is collected deterministically, and root causes are represented as hypotheses rather than unsupported conclusions.

## What it does

- Synchronizes open GitHub issues with pagination and pull-request filtering.
- Detects likely duplicate issue pairs using title similarity and token overlap.
- Separates severity, urgency, and engineering priority.
- Applies weighted scoring plus hard P0/P1 override rules.
- Builds a cacheable repository map with languages, runtime files, entrypoints, imports, classes, functions, tests, and detected frameworks.
- Ranks candidate files and symbols using issue-to-code evidence.
- Produces confirmed facts, confidence-scored hypotheses, and a safe reproduction plan.
- Exposes both a Typer CLI and FastAPI endpoints.

## Why two stages

```text
all open issues -> normalize -> deduplicate -> prioritize -> ranked queue
                                                        |
                                                Top-K / selected
                                                        v
repository map -> locate files/symbols -> hypotheses -> reproduction plan -> human review
```

## Quick start

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and uv.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xbz123/repo-issue-intelligence.git
cd repo-issue-intelligence
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest -q
```

Run the included offline demo:

```bash
uv run rii rank examples/issues.json --output data/ranked.json
uv run rii duplicates examples/issues.json --threshold 0.35
uv run rii index . --output data/repository-map.json
uv run rii investigate-issue examples/issues.json --issue 184 --repo . --output reports/issue-184.json
```

## Analyze a real GitHub repository

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Set GITHUB_TOKEN in .env
uv run rii sync owner/repository --limit 100 --output data/issues.json
uv run rii rank data/issues.json --output data/ranked.json
uv run rii investigate-issue data/issues.json --issue 123 --repo /path/to/clone --output reports/issue-123.json
```

## Run the API

```bash
uv run rii serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

OpenAPI documentation: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

Core endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /v1/issues/score`
- `POST /v1/issues/rank`
- `POST /v1/repository/index`

## Priority model

```text
priority_score =
    0.30 * severity
  + 0.20 * urgency
  + 0.15 * affected_users
  + 0.10 * reproducibility
  + 0.10 * duplicate_count
  + 0.10 * release_blocking
  + 0.05 * recency
```

Hard rules override the average:

- Actively exploited security issue -> P0.
- Reproducible data loss or corruption -> P0.
- Release blocker -> at least P1.
- Missing diagnostic details -> `needs_information=true`.

Every result includes factor values and human-readable reasons.

## Project layout

```text
src/repo_issue_intelligence/
  api.py                 FastAPI service
  cli.py                 command-line interface
  duplicates.py          issue similarity and duplicate candidates
  github_client.py       paginated GitHub REST synchronization
  investigator.py        file/symbol ranking and hypothesis generation
  models.py              typed domain models
  repository_index.py    repository map and Python AST index
  scoring.py             severity, urgency, priority rules
  service.py             ranking orchestration
```

See `docs/architecture.md` for boundaries and planned milestones.

## Evaluation plan

Use closed issues with linked fix PRs as ground truth:

- Priority agreement with maintainer behavior.
- Duplicate detection precision/recall/F1.
- File Recall@5 against files changed by the fix PR.
- Symbol Recall@10 against functions modified by the fix.
- Hypothesis evidence coverage.
- Reproduction-plan acceptance rate.
- Latency and cost per issue.

## Safety and scope

The MVP does not execute generated commands, modify the target repository, post labels, close issues, or create pull requests. Investigation ends at a human review gate.
